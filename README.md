 # Credit Card Validator

This is a simple credit card validator written in Go. It uses the Luhn algorithm to validate the card number.

## How to use

To use the validator, simply run the `main.go` file. You will be prompted to enter the digits of the card number. The validator will then print out whether or not the card number is valid.

## Code explanation

The code is relatively straightforward. First, the user is prompted to enter the digits of the card number. The card number is then read from the console and converted into a slice of integers.

Next, the Luhn algorithm is used to validate the card number. The Luhn algorithm is a simple checksum algorithm that can be used to validate credit card numbers. The algorithm works by adding up the digits of the card number in a specific order. If the sum of the digits is divisible by 10, then the card number is valid.

Finally, the validator prints out whether or not the card number is valid.

## Step-by-step explanation

Here is a step-by-step explanation of the code:

1. The user is prompted to enter the digits of the card number.
2. The card number is read from the console and converted into a slice of integers.
3. The Luhn algorithm is used to validate the card number.
4. The validator prints out whether or not the card number is valid.
